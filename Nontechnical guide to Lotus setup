Steps to set up Lotus blockchain:
Insert SD card into laptop in order to flash cryptopie file (~1 GB)
Use balenaEtcher to flash the file onto the SD card
Takes around 1 hour to complete 
Insert SD card back into raspberry pi 
After a few seconds, you will be asked for a user and password to which both are root
User: root, pwrd: root
You will automatically be asked to change the password to a personal one 
As you type nothing with appear on the screen for password protection
Next, make sure that the pi is connected to wifi in order to connect to the github properly
Either connect the pi directly to your wifi box using an ethernet cable or you can find some answers online on how to connect the pi wirelessly to the wifi 
Now, you should be able to start building the node 
Start with: starport network chain create lotus https://github.com/babyblockchains/lotus
This step should install the relevant files off the github site for lotus 
It will also take a few moments to complete
It will ask to create a starport account or login to a preexisting account 
To create an account, choose the correct option (hitting enter when the create an account option is highlighted) 
You will be asked for an account name (this can be anything, i.e your name)
You will be asked for an account keyring passphrase (aka a password)
Choose any password and as above it will not show the password typed out on the screen 
Now, use: curl https://github.com/faddat to clone the data from the faddat github site 
In order to complete this step, the pi needs to be properly connected to wifi 
Now, check the chain list by: starport network chain list 
Join the chain by: starport network chain join lotus
